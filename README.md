## Project 2-2 : Email Spam Classification with Sentiment Analysis

# Description:
This project is about the task of classifying an email of classifying an email as either spam or not spam.

The dataset used for this project is the 'Spambase' dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains a total of 4601 emails, of which 1813 are spam emails and the rest are non-spam emails.

The project uses the Naive Bayes classifier and Support Vector Machines to classify the emails. In phase 3, our models will also use sentiment analysis to improve the accuracy of the classification.

# To run the code:

Access the folder named 'web_server' and run the app.py file from this folder to start the gateway server for our JavaFX application and then access the folder named 'GUI_java', then subfolder 'src' and run App.java. From this point, our application will start and you will be able to test our service.

NOTE : JavaFX is required in order to be able to run our app. Make sure to have it's library installed before running our code.
